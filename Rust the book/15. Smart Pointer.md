## Smart Pointers

A *pointer* is a general concept for variable that contains an address in memory. This address refers to , or "points at," some other data. The most. common kind of pointer in Rust is a reference, which you learned about in Chapter4. References are indicated by the `&` symbol and borrow the value they point to. They don't have any special capabilities other than referring to data. Also, they don't have any overhead and are the kind of pointer we use most often.

*Smart pointers*, on the other hand, are data structures that not only act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities. The concept of smart pointers isn't unique to Rust: smart pointers originated in C++ and exist in other languages as well. In Rust, the different smart pointers defined in the standard library provide functionality beyond that provided by references. One example that we'll explore in this chapter is the *reference counting* smart pointer type. This pointer enables you to have multiple owners of data by keeping track of the number of owners  and, when no owners remain, cleaning up the data.

In Rust, which uses the concept of ownership and borrowing, an additional difference between references and smart pointers is that only borrow data; in contrast, in many cases, smart pointers *own* the data they point to.

We've already encountered a few smart pointers in this book, such as `String` and `Vec<T>` in Chapter 8, although we didn't call them smart pointers at the time. Both these types count as smart pointers because they own some memory and allow you to manipulate it. They also hhave metadata (such as their capacity) and extra capabilities. or guardanntees (such as with`String` ensureing its data will always be valid UTF-8).

Smart pointers. are usually implemented using structs. The characteristic that distinguishes a smart pointer form an ordinary struct is that smart pointes implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits.  The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so you can write code that works with either references or smart pointers. The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that is run when an instance. Of the smart pointer goes out of scope. In this chapter, we'll discuss both traits and demonstrate. why they're important. to smart pointers.

Given that the smart pointer pattern is general design pattern used frequently in Rust, this chapter won't cover every existing smart pointer. Many. libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own. We'll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:

- `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap
- `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
- In addition, we'll cover the *interior mutablility* pattern where an immutable type exposes an API for mutating an interior value. We'll also discuss *reference cycles*: how they can leak memeory and how to prevent them.

Let's dive in!

### Using `Box<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap

The most straightforward smart pointer is a *box*, whose type is written `Box<T>`. Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. What remainns on the stack is the pointer to the heap data. Refer to Chapter4 to review the difference between the stack and the heap.

Boxes don't have performance overhead,other than storing their data. on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don't have many extra capabilities either. You'll use them most often inthese situations:

- When you have a type whose size can't be. Known at compile time and you want to use. a value of that type in a context that. requires an exact size
- When. You have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership. but ensure the data won't be copied when you do so
- When you. want to own a value and you care only that it's a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type

We'll demonstrate the first situation in the [Enabbling Recursive Types with Boxes]() section. In the second case, transferring ownership of a large amount of data can take a long time because the data is copied around on the stack. To improve performance in this situation, we can store the large. amount of data on the heap in a box. To improve performance in this situation, we can store the large amount of data on the heap in a box, Then, only the small amount of poinnter data is copied around on the stack, while the data it references stays in one place on the heap. The third case is known as a. triat object, and Chapter 17 devotes an entire section, ["Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types"](), just to that topic. So what you learn here you'll learn here you'll apply again n Chapter 17!

#### Using a `Box<T>` to Store Data on the Heap

Before we discuss this use case for `Box<T>`, we'll. cover the syntax and how to interact with values stored within a  `Box<T>`.

Listing 15-1 shows how to use a box to store an `i32` value on the heap:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
  let b = Box::new(5);
  println!("b = {}", b);
}
```

###### Listing 15-1: Storing an `i32` value on  the heap using a box

We define the variable  `b` to have the value of a `Box` that points. to the value `5`, which is allocated on the heap. This program will print `b = 5`; in this case, we can access the data in the box similar to how we would if this data were on the stack. Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of scope, as `b` does at the end of `mian`, it will be deallocated. The deallocation happens for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).

#### Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes

At compile time, Rust needs to know how much space a type takes up. One type whose size can't be known at. Compile time is a `recursive type`, where a value can have as. part of it self another vlue of the same type. Because this nesting of values could theoretically continue infinitely, Rust doesn't know how much space a value of recursive type needs. However, boxes have a known size, so by inserting a box in a recursive type definition, you can have recursive types.

Let's explore the *cons list*, which is a data type common in functional programming languages, as an. Example of a recursive type. The cons list type we'll define is straightforward except for the recursion; therefore, the concepts in the example we'll work with will be useful any time you get. into more complex situations involving recursive types.

##### More Information About the Cons List

A *cons list* is a data structure that comes from the Lisp programming language and its dialects. In Lisp, the `cons` function (short for "construct function"). Constructs a new pair from its two arguments, which usually are a single value and another pair. These pairs containing pairs form a list.

The cons funnction concept has made its way into more general functional programming jargon: "to cons *x* onto *y*" informally means to construct a new container instance by putting the element *x* at. the start of this new container, followed by the container *y*.

Each item in a cons list contains two elements: the value of the current item and the next item.  The last item in the list contains only a value called `Nil` without a next item. A cons list is produced by recursively calling the `cons` function. The canonical name to deote the base case lof the recursion is `Nil`. Note that this is not the same as the "null" or "nil" concept in Chapter 6, which is a invalid or absent value.

Although functional programming languages use cons lists frequently, the cons list isn't a commonly used data structure in Rust. Most of the time when you have list of items in Rust,  `Vec<T>>` is a better choice to use. Other, more complex recursive data types are useful in various situations, but by starting with the cons list, we can explore how boxes let us define a recursive data type without much distraction.

Listing 15-2 contains an enum definition for a cons list. Note that this code won;t compile yet because the `List` type doesn't have a known size, which we'll demonstrate.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32,List),
  Nil,
}
```

###### Listing 15-2: The first attempt at defining an enum to represent a cons list data structure of `i32` values

> Note: We're implementing a cons list that holds only `i32` values for the purposes of this example. We could have implemented it using generics, as we. Discussed in Chapter 10, to define a cons list type that could store values of any type.

Using the `List` type to store the list `1, 2, 3` would look like the code in Listing 15-3:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use crate::List:{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
  let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}
```

###### Listing 15-3: Using. the `List` enum to store the list `1, 2, 3`

The first `Cons` value holds `1` and another `List` value. This `List` value is another `Cons` value that holds `2` and another `List` value. This `List` value is one more `Cons` value that holds `3` and a `List` value, which is finally `Nil`, the non-recursive variant that signals the end of the list.

If we try to compile the code in Listing 15-3, we get the error shown in Listing 15-4:

```bash
error[E0072]: recursive type `List` has infinite size
 --> src/main.rs:1:1
  |
1 | enum List {
  | ^^^^^^^^^ recursive type has infinite size
2 |     Cons(i32, List),
  |               ----- recursive without indirection
  |
  = help: insert indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) at some point to
  make `List` representable
```

###### Listing 15-4: The error we get when attempting to define a rescursive enum

The error shows this type "has infinite size." The reason is that we've defined `List` with a variant that is recursive: it holds another value of itself directly. As a result, Rust can't figure out how much space it needs to store a `List` value. Let's break down why we get this error a bit. First,  let's look at how Rust decides how much space it needs to store a value of a non-recursive type.

#### Computing the Size of a Non-Recursive Type

Recall the `Message` enum we defined in Listing 6-2 when we discussed enum definitions in Chapter 6:

```rust
enum Message {
  Quit,
  Move { x: i32, y: i32},
  Write(String),
  ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

To determine how much space to allocate for a `Message` value, Rust goes through each of the variants to see which variannt needs the most space. Rust sees that `Message::Quit` doesn't need any space, `Message::Move` needs enough space to store two `i32` values, and so forth. Because only one variant will be used, the most space a `Message` value will need is the space it would take to store the largest of its variants.

Contrast this with what happens when Rust tries to determine how much space a recursive type like the `List` enum in Listing 15-2 needs. The compiler starts by looking at the `Cons` variant, which holds a value of type `i32` and a value of type `List`. Therefore, `Cons` needs an amount of space equal to the size of an `i32` plus the size of a `List`. To figure out how much memory the `List` type needs, the compiler looks at the variants, starting with the `Cons` variant. The `Cons` variant holds a value of type `i32` and a value of type `List`, and this process continues infinitely, as shown in Figure value of type `i32` and a value of type `List`, and this process continues infinitely, as shown in. Figure 15-1.

<img src="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl15-01.svg" style="zoom:10%;" />

###### Figure 15-1: An infinite `List` consisting of infinite `Cons` variants

#### Using `Box<T>` to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size

Rust can't figure out how much space to allocate for recursively defined types, so the compiler gives the error in Listing 15-4. But the error does include this helpful suggestion:

```bash
= help: insert indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) at some point to
  make `List` representable
```

In this suggestion, "indirection" means that instead of storing a value directly, we'll change the data structure to store the value indirectly by storing. a pointer to the value instead.

Because a `Box<T>` is a pointer, Rust always knows how much space a `Box<T>` needs: a pointer's size doesn't change based on the amount of data it's pointing to. This means we can put a `Box<T>` inside the `Cons` variant instead of another `List` value directly. The `Box<T>` will point to the next `List` value that will be on the heap rather than inside the `Cons` variant. Conceptually, we still have a list, created with lists "holding" other lists, but this implementation is now more like placing the items next to one another rather than inside one another.

We can change the definition of the `List` enum in Listing 15-2 and the usage of the `List` in Listing 15-3 to the code in Listing 15-5, which will compile:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, Box<List>),
  Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
  let list = Cons(1,
  		Box::new(Cons(2,
  				Box::new(Cons(3,
  						Box::new(Nil))))));
}
```

###### Listinng 15-2: Definition of `List` that uses `Box<T>` in order to have a known size

The `Cons` variant will need the size of an `i32` plus the space to store the box's pointer data. The `Nil` variant stores no values, so it needs less space than the `Cons` variant. We now know that any `List` value will take up the size of an `i32` plus the size of a box's pointer data. By using a box, we've broken the infinite, recursive chain, so the compiler can figure out the size it needs to store a `List` value. Figure 15-2 shows what the `Cons` variant looks like now.

![](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl15-02.svg)

###### Figure 15-2:  A `List` that is not infinitely sized because `Cons` holds a `Box`

Boxes provide only the indirection and heap allocation; they don't have any other special capabilities, like those we'll see with the other smart pointer types. They also don;t have any performance overhead that these special capabilities incur, so they can be useful in cases like the cons list where the indirection is the only feature we need. We'll link at more use cases for boxes in Chapter 17, too.

The `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer because it implements the `Deref` trait, which allows `Box<T>` values to be treated like references. When a `Box<T>` value goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned up as well because of the `Drop` trait implementation. Let's explore these two traits in more detail. These two traits will be even more important to the functionality provied by the other smart pointer types we'll discuss in the rest of this chapter.

### Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the `Deref` Trait

Implementing the `Deref` trait allows you to customize the behavior of the *dereference operator*, `*` (as opposed to the multiplication or glob operator). By implementing `Deref` in such a way that a smart pointer can be treated like a regular reference, you can write code that operates on references and use that code with smart pointers too.

Let's first look at how the dereference operator works with regular references. Then we'll try to define a custom type that behaves like `Box<T>`, and see why the dereference operator doesn't work like a reference on our newly defined type. We'll explore how implementing the `Deref` trait makes it possible for smart pointers to work in a similar way as references. Then we'll look at Rust's *deref coercion* feature and how it lets us work with either references or smart pointers.

> Note: there's one big defference between the `MyBox<T>` type we're about to build and the real `Box<T>` : our version will not store its data on the heap. We are focusing this example on `Deref`, so were the data is actually stored is less important than the pointer-like behavior.

#### Following the Pointer to the Value with te Dereference Operator

A regular reference is a type of pointer, and one way to think of a pointer is as an arrow to a value stored somewhere else. In Listing 15-6, we create a reference to an `i32` value and then the dereference operator to follow the reference to the data:

Filenname:src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = &x;
  
  assert_eq!(5, x);
  assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

###### Listing 15-6: Using the dereference operator to follow a reference to an `i32` value

The variable `x` holds an `i32` value, `5`. We set `y` equal to a reference to `x`. We can assert that `x` is equal to `5`. However, if we want to make an assertion about the value in `y`, we have to use `*y` to follow the reference to the value it's pointing to (hence *dereference*). Once we dereference `y`, we have access to the integer value `y` is pointing to that we can compare with `5`.

If we tried to write `assert_eq!(5, y);` instead, we would get this compilation error:

```bash
error[E0277]: can't compare `{integer}` with `&{integer}`
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
6 |     assert_eq!(5, y);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no implementation for `{integer} == &{integer}`
  |
  = help: the trait `std::cmp::PartialEq<&{integer}>` is not implemented for
  `{integer}`
```

Comparinng a number and a reference to a number isn't allowed because they're different types. We must use te dereference operator to follow the reference to the value it's pointing to.

#### Using `Box<T>` Like a Reference

We can rewrite the code in Listing 15-6 to use a `Box<T>` instead of a reference; the dereference operator will work as shown in Listing 15-7:

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = Box::new(x);
  
  assert_eq!(5, x);
  assert_eq!(5, y);
}
```

###### Listing 15-7: Using the dereference operator on a `Box<i32>`.

The only difference between Listing 15-7 and Listing 15-6 is that here we set `y` to be an instance of a box pointing to the value in `x` rather than a reference pointing to the value of `x`. In the last assertion, we can use the dereference operator to follow the box's pointer in the same way that we did when `y` was a reference. Next, we'll explore what is special about `Box<T>` that enables us to use the dereference operator by defining our own box type.

#### Defining Our Own Smart Pointer

Let's build a smart pointer similar to the `Box<T>` type provided by the standard library to experience how smart pointers behave differently from references by default. Then we'll look at how to add. the ability to use the dereference operator.

The `Box<T>` type is ultimately defined as a tuple struct with one element,  so Listing 15-8 defines a `MyBox<T>` type in the same way. We'll. also define a `new` function to match the `new` function defined on `Box<T>`.

Filenname:src/main.rs

```rust
struct MyBox<T>(T);
impl<T> MyBox<T> {
  fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
    MyBox(x)
  }
}
```

###### Listing 15-8: Defining a `MyBox<T>` type

We define a struct named `MyBox`. and declare a generic parameter `T`, because we want our type to. Hold values of any type. The `MyBox` type is a tuple struct with one element of type `T`. The `MyBox::new` function takes one parameter of type `T` and returns a `MyBox` instance that holds the value passed in.

Let's try adding the `main` function in Listing 15-7 to Listing 15-8 and changing it to use the `MyBox<T>` type we've defined instead of `Box<T>`.  The code in Listing 15-9 won't compile because Rust doesn't know how to dereference `MyBox`.

Filename:src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let y =. MyBox::new(x);
  
  assert_eq!(5, x);
  assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

###### Listing 15-9: Attempting to use `MyBox<T>` in the same way we used references and `Box<T>`

Hers's the resulting compilation error:

```bash
error[E0614]: type `MyBox<{integer}>` cannot be dereferenced
  --> src/main.rs:14:19
   |
14 |     assert_eq!(5, *y);
   |                   ^^
```

Our `MyBox<T>` type can't be dereferenced because we haven't implemented that ability on our type. To enable dereferencing with the `*` operator, we implement the `Deref` trait.

#### Treating a Type Like a Reference by Implementing the `Deref` Trait

As discussed in Chapter 10, to implement a trait, we need to provide implementations for the trait's required methods. The `Deref` trait, provided by the standard library, requires us to implement one method named `deref` that borrows `self` and returns a reference to the innner data. Listinng 15-10 contains an implementation of `Deref` to add to the definition of `MyBox`:

Filename:src/main.rs

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
  type Target = T;
  
  fn deref(&self) -> &T {
    &self.0
  }
}
```

###### Listing 15-10: Implementing `Deref` on `MyBox<T>`

The `type Target = T;` syntax defines an associated type for the `Deref` trait to use. Associated types are a slightly differenct way of declaring a generic parameter, but you don't need to worry about them for now; we'll cover them in more detail in Chapter. 19.

We fill in the body of the `deref` method with `&self.0` so `deref` returns a reference to the value we want to access with the `*` operator.  The `main` function in Listing 15-9 that calls `*` on the `MyBox<T>` value now compiles, and the assertions pass!

Without the `Deref` trait, the compiler can only dereference `&` references. The `deref` method gives the compiler the ability to take a. value of any type that implements `Deref` and call the `deref` method to get a `&` reference that it knows how to dereference.

When we  entered `*y` in Listing. 15-9, behind the scenes. Rust actually ran this code:

```rust
*(y.deref())
```

Rust substitutes the `*` operator with a call to the `deref` method and then a plan dereference so we don't have to think about. Whether or not we need to call the `deref` method. This Rust feature lets us write code that functions identically whether we have. a regular reference or a type that implemennts `Deref`.

The reason the `deref` method returns a reference to a value,  and that the plain dereference outside the parentheses in `*(y.deref())` is still necessary, is the ownership system. If the `deref` method returned the value directly instead of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of `self`. We don't want to take ownership of the inner value inside `MyBox<T>` in this case or in most cases where we use the dereference operator.

Note that the `*` operator is replaced with a call to the `deref` method and then a call to the `*` operator just once, each time we use a `*` in our code. Because the substitution of the `*` operator does not recurse infinitely, we end up with data of type `i32`, which matches the `5` in `assert_eq!` in Listing 15-9.

#### Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods

*Deref coercion* is convenience that Rust performs on arguments to functions and methods. Deref coercion converts a reference to a type that implements `Deref` into a reference to a type that `Deref` can convert the originnal type into. Deref coercion happens automatically when we pass a reference to a particular type's value as an argument to a function or  method that doesn't match the parameter type in the function or method definitionn. A sequence of calls to the `deref` method converts the type we provided into the type the parameter needs.

Deref coercion was added to Rust so that programmer writing function and method calls don't need to add as many explicit references and dereferences with `&` and `*`. The deref coercion feature also lets us write more code that can work for either references or smart pointers.

To see deref coercion in action, let's use the `MyBox<T>` type we defined in Listing 15-8 as well as the implementation of `Deref` that we added in Listing 15-10. Listing 15-11 shows the definition of a function that has a string slice parameter:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn hello(name:  &str) {
  println!("Hello,  {}!", name);
}
```

###### Listing 15-12:  Calling `hello` with reference to a `MyBox<String>` value, which works because of deref coercion

Here we're calling the `hello` function with the argument `&m`, which is a reference to a `MyBox<String>` value. Because we implemented the `Deref` trait on `MyBox<T>` in Listing 15-10, Rust can turn `&MyBox<String>` into `&String` by calling `deref`. The standard library provides an implementation of `Deref` on `String` that returns a string slice, and this is in the API documentation for `Deref`. Rust calls `deref` again to turn the `&String` into `&str`,  which matches the `hello` functions's definition.

If Rust didn't implement deref coercion, we would have to write the code in Listing 15-13 instead of the code in Listing 15-12 to call `hello` with a value of type `&MyBox<Strinng`.

```rust
fn main() {
  let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
  hello(&(*m)[..]);
}
```

###### Listing 15-13: The code we would have to write if Rust didn't have deref coercion

The `(*m)` dereferences the `MyBox<String>` into `String`. Then the `&` and `[..]` take a string slice of the `String` that is equal to the whole. string to amtch the signature of `hello`. The code without deref coercions is harder to read, write, and understand with all of these symbols involved. Deref coercions allows Rust to handle these conversions for us automatically.

When the `Deref` trait is defined for the types involved, Rust will analyze the types and use `Deref::deref` as many times as necessary to get a reference to match the parameter's type. The number of times that `Deref::deref` needs to be inserted is resolved at compile time, so there is no runtime penalty for taking advantage of deref coercion!

#### How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability

Similar to how you use the `Deref` trait to override the `*` operator on immutable references, you can use the `DerefMut` trait. to override the `*` operator on mutable references.

Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:

- From `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T` to `&mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T`to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`

The first two cases are the same except for mutablility. The first case states that if you have a `&T`, and `T` implements `Deref` to some type `U`, you can get a `&U` transparently. The second case states that the same deref coercion happens for mutable references.

The third case is trickier: Rust will also coerce a mutable reference. to an immutabble one. BBut the reverse is not possible: immutable references will never coerce to mutable references. Because of the borrowing rules, if you. have a mutable reference, that mutable reference must be the only. Reference to that data(otherwise, the program wouldn't compile). Converting one mutable reference to one immutable reference will never break the borrowing rules. Coverting an immutable reference to a mutable reference would require that there is only one immutable reference to that data, and the borrowing rules don;t guarantee that. Therefore, Rust can't make the assumption that converting an immutable reference to a mutable reference is possible.

### Running Code on Cleanup with the `Drop` Trait

The second trait important to the smart pointer pattern is `Drop`, which lets you customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope. You can provide an implementation for the `Drop` trait on any type, and the code you specify can be used to release resources like files or network connections. We're introducing `Drop` in the context of smart pointers because the functionality of the `Drop` trait is almost always used when implementing a smart pointer. For example, `Box<T>` customizes `Drop` to deallocate the space on the heap that the box points to.

In some languages, the programmer must call code to free memory or resources every time they finish using an instance of a smart pointer. If they forget,  the system might become overloaded and crash. In Rust, you can specify that a particular bit of code be run whenever a value goes out of scope, and the compiler will insert this code automatically. As a result, you don't need to be careful about placing cleanup code everywhere in a. Program that an instance of a particular type is finished with-you still won't leak resources!

Specify the code to run when a value goes out of scope by implementing the `Drop` trait. The `Drop` trait requires you to implement one method named `drop` that takes a mutable reference to `self`. To see when Rust calls `drop`, let's implement `drop` with `printlin!` statements for now.

Listing 15-14 shows a `CustomSmartPointer` struct whose only custom functionality is that it will print `Dropping CustomSmartPointer!` when the. instance goes out of scope. This example demonstrates when Rust runs the `drop` function.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
  data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
  fn drop(&mut self) {
    println!("Droppinng CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!", self.data);
  }
}

fn main() {
  let c = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from("my stuff")};
  let d = CustomSmartPointer { data; String::from("other stuff")};
  println!("CustomSmartPointers created.");
}

###### Listing 15-14:  A `CustomSmartPointer` struct that implements the `Drop` trait where we would put our cleanup code

The `Drop` trait is included in the prelude, so we don't. need to bring it into scope. We implement the `Drop` trait on `CustomSmartPointer` annd provide an implementation for the `drop` method that calls `println!`. The body of the `drop` function is where you would place any logic that you wanted to run when an instance of your type goes out of scope. We're printing some text here to demonstrate when Rust will call `drop`.

In `main`, we create two instances of `CustomSmartPointer` and then print `CustomSmartPointers created.`. At the end of `main`, our instances of `CustomSmartPointer` will go out of scope, and Rust will call the code we put in the `drop` method, printing our final message. Note that we didn't need to call the `drop` method explicitly.

When we run this program, we'll see the following output:

```bash
CustomSmartPointers created.
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `other stuff`!
Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `my stuff`!
```

Rust automatically called `drop` for us when our instances went out of scope, calling the code we specified. Variables are dropped in the reverse order of their creation, so `d` was dropped before `c`. This example gives you a visual guide to how the `drop` method works; usually you would specify the cleanup code that your type needs to run rather than a print message.

#### Dropping a Value Early with `std::mem::drop`

Unfortunately, it's not straightforward to disable the automatic `drop` functionnality. Disabling `drop` isn;t usually necessary; the whole point of the `Drop` trait is that it's taken care of automatically.  Occasionally, however, you might want to clean up a value early. One example is when using smart pointers that manage locks:  you might want to force the `drop` method that releases the lock to run so other code in the same scope can acquire the lock. Rust doesn't let you call the `Drop` trait's `drop` method manually; instead you have to call the `std::mem::drop` function provided by the standard library if you want to force a value to be dropped before the end of its scope.

If we try to call the `Drop` trait's `drop` method manually by modifying the `main` function from Listing 15-14, as shown in Listing 15-15, we'll get a compiler error:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = CustomSmartPointer { data: String::from("some data")};
  println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
  c.drop();
  println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```

###### Listing 15-15: Attempting to call the `drop` method from the `Drop` trait manually to clean up early

When we try to compile this code, we'll get this error:

```bash
error[E0040]: explicit use of destructor method
  --> src/main.rs:14:7
   |
14 |     c.drop();
   |       ^^^^ explicit destructor calls not allowed
```

This error message states that we're not allowed to explicitly call `drop`. The error message uses the term *destructor*, which is the general programming term for a function that cleans up an instance. A *destructor* is analogous to a *constructor*, which creates an instance. The `drop` function in Rust is one particular destructor.

Rust doesn't let us call `drop` explicitly because Rust would still automatically call `drop` on the value at the end of `main`. This would be a *double free* error because Rust would be trying to clean up the same value twice.

We can't disable the automatic insertion of `drop` when a value goes out of scope, and we can't call the `drop` method explicitly. So, if we need to force a value to be cleaned up early, we can use the `std::mem::drop` function.

The `Std::mem::drop` function is different from the `drop` method in the `Drop` trait. We call it by passing the value we want to force to be dropped early as an argument. The function is in. The preludee, so we can modify `main` in Listing 15-15 to call the `drop` function, as shown in Listing 15-16:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = CustomSmartPointer {data: String::from("some data")};
  println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
  drop(c);
  println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```

###### Listing 15-16: Calling `std::mem::drop` to explicitly drop a value before it goes out of scope

Running this code will print the following:

```bash
error[E0040]: explicit use of destructor method
  --> src/main.rs:14:7
   |
14 |     c.drop();
   |       ^^^^ explicit destructor calls not allowed
```

The text ```Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `some data`!``` is printed between the `CustomSmartPointer created.` and `CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.`  text, showing that the `drop` method code is called to drop`c` at that point.

You can use code specified in a `Drop` trait implementation in many ways to make cleanup convenient and safe: for instance, you could use it to create your own memory allocator! With the `Drop` trait and Rust's ownership system, you don't have to remember to cleanup because Rust does it automatically.

You also don't have to worry about problems resulting from accidentally cleaning up values still in use: the ownership system that makes sure references are always valid also  ensures that `drop` gets called only once when the value is no longer being used.

Now that we've examined `Box<T>` and some of characteristics of smart pointers, let's look at a few other smart pointers defined in the standard library.

### `Rc<T>`, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

In the majority of cases, ownership is clear: you know exactly which variable owns a given value. However, there are cases when a single value might have multiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges that point to it. A node shouldn't be cleaned up unless it doesn't have any edges pointing to it.

To enable multiple ownership, Rust has a type called `Rc<T>`, which is an abbreviation for *reference counting*. The `Rc<T>` type keeps track of the number of references to a value which determines whether or not a value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.

Imaging `Rc<T>` as a TV in a family room. When one person enters to watch TV, they turn it on. Others can come into the room and watch the TV. When the lasted person leaves the room, they turn off the TV because it's no longer being used. If someone turns off the TV while others are still watching it, there would be uproar from the remaining TV watchers!

We use the `Rc<T>` type when we want to allocate some data on the heap for multiple parts of our program to read and we can't determine at compile time which part will finish using the data last. If we knew wihich part would finish last, we could just make that part the data's owner, and the normal ownership rules enforced at compile time would take effect.

Note that `Rc<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. When we discuss concurrency in Chapter 16, we'll cover how to do reference counting in multithreaded programs.

#### Using `Rc<T> to Share Data

Let's return to our cons list example in Listing 15-5. Recall that we defined it using `Box<T>`. This time, we'll create two lists that both share ownership of a third list. Conceptually, this looks similar to Figure 15-3:

![](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/img/trpl15-03.svg)

###### Figure 15-3: Two lists, `b` and `c`, sharing ownership of a third list, `a`

We'll create list `a` that contains 5 and then 10. Then we'll make two more lists: `b` that starts with 3 and `c` starts with 4. Both `b` and `c` lists will then continue on to the first `a` list containing 5 and 10. In other words, both lists will share the first containing 5 and 10.

Trying to implement this scenario using our definition of `List` with `Box<T>` won't work, as shown in Listing 15-17:

Filename:src/main.rs

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, Box<List>),
  Nil,
}
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
  let a = Cons(5,
  		Box::new(Cons(10,
  					Box::new(Nil))));
  
  let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
  let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
}
```

###### Listing 15-17: Demonstrating we're not allowed to have two lists using `Box<T>` that try to share ownership of a third list

When we compile this code, we get this error:

```bash
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
  --> src/main.rs:13:30
   |
12 |     let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
   |                              - value moved here
13 |     let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
   |                              ^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: move occurs because `a` has type `List`, which does not implement
   the `Copy` trait
```

The `Cons` variants own the data they hold, so when we create the `b` list, `a` is moved into `b` and `b` owns `a`. Then, when we try to use `a` again when creating `c`, we're not allowed to because `a` has been moved.

We could change the definition of `Cons` to hold references instead, but then we would have to specify lifetime parameters. By specifying lifetime parameters, we would be specifying that every element in the list will live at least as long as the entire list. The borrow checker wouldn't let us compile `let a = Cons(10, Nil);` for example, because the temporary `Nil` value would be dropped before `a` could take a reference to it.

Instead, we'll change our definition of `List` to use `Rc<T>` in place of `Box<T>`, as shown in Listing 15-18. Each `Cons` variant will now hold a value and an `Rc<T>` pointing to a `List`. When we create `b`, instead of taking ownership of `a`, we'll clone the `Rc<List>` that `a` is holding, thereby increasing the number of references from one to two and letting `a` and `b` share ownership of the data in that `Rc<List>`. We'll also clone `a` when creating `c`, increasing the number of references from two to three. Every time we call `Rc::clone`, the reference count to the data within the `Rc<List>` will increase, and the data won't be cleaned up unless there are zero references to it.

```rust
enum List {
  Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
  Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
  let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
  let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
  let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```

###### Listing 15-18: A definition of  `List` that uses `Rc<T>`

We need to add a `use` statement to bring `Rc<T>` into scope because it's not in the prelude. In `main`, we create the list holding 5 and 10 and store it in a new `Rc<List>` in `a`. Then when we create `b` and `c`, we call the `Rc::clone` function and pass a reference to the `Rc<List>` in `a` as an argument.

We could have called `a.clone()` rather than `Rc::clone(&a)`, but Rust's convention is to use `Rc::clone` in this case. The implementation of  `Rc::clone` doesn't make a deep copy of all the data like most types' implementations of `clone` do. The call to `Rc::clone` only increments the reference count, which doesn't take much time. Deep copies of data can take a lot of time. By using `Rc::clone` for reference counting, we can visually distinguish between the deep-copy kinds of clones and the kinds of clones that increase the reference count. When looking for performance problems in the code, we only need to consider the deep-copy clones and can disregard calls to `Rc::clone`.

#### Cloning an `Rc<T>` Increase the Reference Count

Let's change our working example in Listing 15-18 so we can see the reference counts changing as we create and drop references to the `Rc<List>` in `a`.

In Listing 15-19, we'll change `main` so it has an inner scope around list `c`; then we can see how the reference count changes when `c` goes out of scope.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn mian() {
  let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
  println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
  let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
  println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
  {
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
  }
  println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
}
```

###### Listing 15-19: Printing the reference count

At each point in the program where the reference count changes, we print the reference count, which we can get by calling the `Rc::strong_count` function. The function is named `strong_count` rather than `count` because the `Rc<T>` type also has a `weak_count`; we'll see what `weak_count` is used for in the ["Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an `Rc<T>` into a `Weak<T>"]() section.

The code prints the following:

```bash
count after creating a = 1
count after creating b = 2
count after creating c = 3
count after c goes out of scope = 2
```

We can see that the `Rc<List>` in `a` has an initial reference count to 1; then each time we call `clone`, the count goes up by 1. When `c` goes out of scope, the count goes down by 1. We don't have to call a function to decrease the reference count like we have to call `Rc::clone` to increase the reference count: the implementation of the `Drop` trait decreases the reference count automatically when an `Rc<T>` value goes out of scope.

What we can't see in this example is that when `b` and then `a` goes out of scope at the end of `main`, the count is then 0, and the `Rc<List>` is cleaned up completely at that point. Using `Rc<T>` allows a single value to have multiple owners, and the count ensures that the value remains valid as long as any of the owners still exist.

Via immutable references, `Rc<T>` allows you to share data between multiple parts of your program for reading only. If `Rc<T>` allowed you to have multiple mutable borrows to the same place can cause data races and inconsistencies. But being able to mutate data is very useful! In the next section, we'll discuss the interior mutability pattern and the `RedCell<T>` type that you can use in conjunction with an `Rc<T>` to work with this immutability restriction.

### `RefCell<T>` and the Interior Mutability Pattern

*Interior mutability* is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data; normally, this action is disallowed by the borrowing rules. To mutate data, the pattern use `unsafe` code inside a data structure to bend Rust's usual rules that govern mutation and borrowing. We haven't yet covered unsafe code; we will in Chapter 19. We can use types that use the interior mutability pattern when we can ensure that the borrowing rules will be followed at runtime, even though the compiler can't guarantee that. The `unsafe` code involved is then wrapped in a safe API, and the outer type is still immutable.

Let's explore this concept by looking at the `RefCell<T>` type that follows the interior mutability pattern.

#### Enforcing Borrowing Rules at Runtime with `RefCell<T>`

Unlike `Rc<T>`, the `RefCell<T>` type represents single ownership over the data it holds. So, what makes `RefCell<T>` different from a type like `Box<T>`? Recall the borrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:

- At any given time, you can have *either* (but not both of) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules' invariants are enfored at compile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced at *runtime*. With references, if you break these rules, you'll get a cimpiler error. With `RefCell<T>`, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.

The advantages of checking the borrowing rules at compile time are that errors will be caught sooner in the development process, and there is no impact on runtime performance because all the analysis is completed beforehand. For those reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice is the majority of cases, which is why this is Rusr's default.

The advantage of checking the borrowing rules at runtime instead is that certain memory-safe scenarios are then allowed, whereas they are disallowed by the compile-time checks. Static analysis, like the Rust compiler, is inherently conservative. Some properties of code are impossible to detect by analyzing the code: the most famous example is the Halting Problem, which is beyond the scope of this book but is an interesting topic to research.

Because some analysis is impossible, if the Rust compiler can't be sure the code conplies with the ownership rules, it might reject a correct program; in this way, it's conservative. If Rust accepted an incorrect program, users wouldn't be able to trust in the guarantees Rust makes. However, if Rust rejects a correct program, the programmer will be inconvenienced, but nothing catastrophic can occur. The `RefCell<T>` type is useful when you're sure your code follows the borrowing rules but the compiler is unable to understand and guarantee that.

Similar to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded context. We'll talk about how to get the functionality of `RefCell<T>` in a multithreaded program in Chapter 16.

Here is a reap of the reasons to choose `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>`:

- `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>` have single owners.
- `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>` allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is immutable.

Mutating the value inside an immutable value is the *interior mutability* pattern. Let's look at a situation in which interior mutability is useful and examine how it's possible.

#### Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value

A consequence of the borrowing rules is that when you have an immutable value, you can't borrow it mutably. For example, this code won't compile:

```rust
fn main() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = &mut x;
}
```

If you tried to compile this code, you'd get the following error:

```bash
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable local variable `x` as mutable
 --> src/main.rs:3:18
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - consider changing this to `mut x`
3 |     let y = &mut x;
  |                  ^ cannot borrow mutably
```

However, there are situations in which it would be useful for a value to mutate itself in its methods but appear immutable to other code. Code outside the value's methods would not be able to mutate the value. Using `RefCell<T>` is one way to get the ability to have interior mutability. But `RefCell<T>` doesn't get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow checker in the compiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead. If you violate the rules, you'll get a `panic!` instead of a compiler error.

Let's work through a practical example where we can use `RefCell<T>` to mutate an immutable value and see why that is useful.

#### A Use Case for Interior Mutability: Mock Objects

A *test double* is the general programming concept for a type used in place of another type during testing. *Mock objects* are specific types of test doubles that record what happens during a test so you can assert that the correct actions took place.

Rust doesn't have objects in the same sense as other languages have objects, and Rust doesn't have mock object functionality built into the standard library as some other languages do. However, you can definitely create a struct that will serve the same purposes as a mock object.

Here's the scenario we'll create a library that tracks a value against a maximum value and sends messages based on how close to the maximum value the current value is. This library could be used to keep track of a user's quota for the number of API calls they're allowed to make, for example.

Our library will only provide the functionality of tracking how close to the maximum a value is and what the messages should be at what times. Applications that use our library will be expected to provide the mechanism for sending the messages: the application could put a message in the application, send an email, send a text message, or something else. The library doesn't need to know that detail. All it needs is  something that implements a trait we'll provide called `Messager`. Listing 15-20 shows the library code:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
pub trait Messenger {
  fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}

pub struct LimitTracker<'a, T: Messager> {
  messenger: &'a T,
  value: usize,
  max: usize,
}

impl<'a, T> LimitTracker<'a, T>
	where T: Messager {
    pub fn new(messager: &T, max: usize) -> LimitTracker<T> {
      LimitTracker {
        messenger,
        value: 0,
        max,
      }
    }
    
    pub fn set_value(&mut self, value: usize) {
      self.value = value;
      
      let percentage_of_max = self.value as f64 / self.max as f64;
      
      if percentage_of_max > 1.0 {
        self.messager.send("Error: You are over your quota!");
      } else if percentage_of_max >= 0.9 {
        self.messager.send("Urgent warning: You've used up over 90% of your quota!");
      } else if percentage_of_max >=0.75 {
        self.messager.send("Warning: You're used up over 75% of your quota!");
      }
    }
}
```

###### Listing 15-20: A library to keep track of how close a value is to a maximum value and warn when the value is at certain levels

One important part of this code is that the `Messager` trait has one method called `send` that takes an immutable reference to `self` and the text of the message. This is the interface our mock object needs to have. The other important part is that we want to test the behavior of the `set_value` method on the `LimiitTracker`. We can change what we pass in for the `value` parameter, but `set_value` doesn't return anything for us to make implements the `Messenger` trait and a particular value for `max`, when we pass different numbers for `value`, the messenger is told to send the appropriate messages.

We need a mock object that, instead of sending an email or text message when we call `send`, will only keep track of the messages it's told to send. We can create a new instance of the mock object, create a `LimitTracker` that uses the mock object, call the `set_value` method on `LimitTracker`, and then check that the mock object has the messages we expect. Listing 15-21 shows an attempt to implement a mock object to do just that, but the borrow checker won't allow it:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  use super::*;
  
  struct MockMessenger {
    sent_messages: Vec<String>,
  }
  
  impl MockMessenger {
    fn new() -> MockMessenger {
      MockMessenger { send_messages: vec![]}
    }
  }
  
  impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
      self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
    }
  }
  
  #[test]
  fn it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
    let mock_messager = MockMessenger::new();
    let mut limit_tracker = LimitTracker::new(&mock_messenger, 100);
    limit_tracker.set_value(80);
    assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.len(), 1);
  }
}
```

###### Listing 15-21: An attempt to implement a `MockMessenger` that isn't allowed by the borrow checker

This test code defines a `MockMessenger` struct that has a `sent_messages` field with a `Vec` of `String` values to keep track of the messages it's told to send. We also define an associated function `new` to make it convenient to create new `MockMessenger` values that start with an empty list of messages. We then implement the `Messenger` trait for `MockMessenger` so we can give a `MockMessenger` to a `LimitTracker`. In the definition of the `send` method, we take the give a `MockMessenger` to a `LimitTracker`. In the definition of the `send` method, we take the message passed in as a parameter and store it in the `MockMessenger` list of `sent_messages`.

In the test, we're testing what happens when the `LimitTracker` is told to set `value` to something that is more than 75 percent of the `max` value. First, we create a new `MockMessenger`, which will start with an empty list of messages. Then we create a new `LimitTracker` and give it a reference to the new `MockMessenger` and a `max` value of 1000. We call the `set_value` method on the `LimitTracker` with a value of 80, which is more than 75 percent of 100. Then we assert that the list of messages that the `MockMessenger` is keeping track of should now have one message in it.

However, there's one problem with this test, as shown here:

```bash
error[E0596]: cannot borrow immutable field `self.sent_messages` as mutable
  --> src/lib.rs:52:13
   |
51 |         fn send(&self, message: &str) {
   |                 ----- use `&mut self` here to make mutable
52 |             self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot mutably borrow immutable field
```

We can't modify the `MockMessenger` to keep track of the messages, because the `send` method taks an immutable reference to `self`. We also can't take the suggestion from the error text to use `&mut self` instead, because then the signature of `send` wouldn't match the signature in the `Messenger` trait definition (feel free to try and see what error message you get).

This is a situation in which interior mutability can help! We'll store the `sent_messages` within a `RefCell<T>`, and then the `send` message will be able to modify `sent_messages` to store the messages we've seen. Listing 15-22 shows what that looks like:

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
  use super::*;
  
  struct MockMessenger {
    sent_messages: Vec<String>,
  }
  
  impl MockMessenger {
    fn new() -> MockMessenger {
      MockMessenger { sent_messages: vec![] }
    }
  }
  
  impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
    fn send(&self, message: &str) {
      self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
    }
  }
  
  #[test]
  fn it_sends_an_over_75_percent_warning_message() {
    // --snip--
    assert_eq!(mock_messenger.sent_messages.len(), 1);
  }
}
```

###### Listing 15-22: Using `RefCell<T>` to mutate an inner value while the outer value is considered immutable.

The `sent_messages` field is now of type `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instead of `Vec<String>`. In the `new` function, we create a new `RefCell<Vec<String>>` instance around the empty vector.

For the implementation of the `send` method, the first parameter is still an immutable borrow of `self`, which matches the trait definition. We call `borrow_mut` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` in `self.sent_messages` to get a mutable reference to the value inside the `RefCell<Vec<String>>`, which is the vector. Then we can call `push` on the mutable reference to the vector to keep track of the messages sent during the test.

The last change we have to make is in the assertion: to see how many items are in the inner vector, we call `borrow` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` to get an immutable reference to the vector.

Now that you've seen how to use `RefCell<T>`, let's dig into how it works!

#### Keep Track of Borrows at Runtime with `RefCell<T>`

When creating immutable and mutable references, e
